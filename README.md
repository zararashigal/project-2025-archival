# What is this?
Project 2025.
# Why is this?
There's a tracker website at https://www.project2025.observer/ and if the trump administration shuts it down, things can no longer be tracked and eventually reversed by a new administration!
# How is this?
I've scraped all the data from the observer into text files and compiled a markdown with python. Eternal gratitude to the project 2025 observer project for tracking this psychopath's nonsense.
# When is this needed?
As soon as the trump administration goes after people collecting information and intelligence about the HF's 2025 project. Keep a copy with you, so he can't eradicate the evidence.
# On an ending note, i hope this won't be needed and the next administration will be able to reverse every single project 2025 decision by themselves.
